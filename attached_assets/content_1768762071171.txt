Section Heading:
 Frequently Asked Questions
Layout:
 Accordion-style expandable Q&A.
FAQ Items:
Q1: How do I know which service I need?
A1:
 It depends on your stakeholders' requirements. Banks typically require reviews or audits. Early-stage companies often start with compilations. If you're unsure, schedule a consultation and we'll help you determine the appropriate engagement level based on your specific situation.

Q2: How long does an assurance engagement take?
A2:
 Compilations typically take 2-3 weeks, reviews 3-5 weeks, and audits 6-10 weeks from information request to final report delivery. Timeline depends on your responsiveness to information requests and complexity of your financials.

Q3: What financial statements are included?
A3:
 Standard engagements include Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Cash Flows, and footnote disclosures. We prepare statements in accordance with US GAAP or other applicable accounting frameworks.

Q4: Do you handle nonprofit audits or single audits?
A4:
 Yes. We perform audits for nonprofit organizations, including single audits (Uniform Guidance) for entities with federal grant expenditures over $750,000. Pricing varies based on grant complexity.

Q5: Can you audit our internal controls (SOX compliance)?
A5:
 While we don't perform SOX 404 attestations (public company requirement), we do evaluate internal controls as part of financial statement audits and can provide management letters with control recommendations. For SOC 2 compliance, see our Risk Advisory services.

Q6: What if we have complex accounting issues?
A6:
 We handle revenue recognition (ASC 606), lease accounting (ASC 842), stock-based compensation, and other technical areas. Complex situations may require additional scoping, which we discuss during engagement planning.

Q7: Do you work with our existing accounting team?
A7:
 Yes. We collaborate directly with your CFO, controller, or accounting staff throughout the engagement. We aim to be an extension of your team, not a disruption.

Section Heading:
 How Tax Resolution Works
Steps:
Step 1: Free Consultation
 We review your situation, notices, and IRS account status at no cost or obligation.
Step 2: Case Strategy
 We develop a resolution strategy and provide transparent pricing for your specific situation.
Step 3: Power of Attorney
 We file Form 2848 to represent you directly with the IRS. You no longer have to deal with them.
Step 4: Resolution
 We handle all communication, negotiate on your behalf, and work toward the best possible outcome.

SECTION 7 — FAQ
Q1: What happens if I ignore an IRS notice?
A1:
 Ignoring IRS notices escalates the situation. The IRS can assess additional penalties, file liens, levy your bank accounts, or garnish wages. Every notice has a response deadline—it's critical to act quickly.
Q2: Can you stop a wage garnishment or bank levy?
A2:
 Yes. We can request levy releases and negotiate alternative collection methods like installment agreements. Time is critical—contact us immediately if you've received a levy notice.
Q3: What is an Offer in Compromise?
A3:
 An OIC allows you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount owed if you meet specific financial hardship criteria. We evaluate your eligibility and prepare the application if appropriate.
Q4: How long does tax resolution take?
A4:
 Simple notice responses: 2-4 weeks. Audits: 3-6 months. Complex resolution (OIC, multiple years): 6-12 months. Timeline varies based on IRS workload and case complexity.
Q5: Do I need to speak with the IRS myself?
A5:
 No. Once we file Power of Attorney (Form 2848), all IRS communication goes through us. You won't need to speak with IRS agents directly.
Q6: What if I haven't filed taxes in years?
A6:
 We can prepare prior-year returns and negotiate resolution for both filing and payment obligations. The IRS typically requires 6 years of back returns before considering collection alternatives.

SECTION 7 — FAQ
Q1: What's the difference between a CFO and a bookkeeper/accountant?
A1:
 Bookkeepers record transactions. Accountants ensure compliance and produce financial statements. CFOs provide strategic financial leadership—forecasting, fundraising, modeling, and helping you make better business decisions.
Q2: Do I need a full-time CFO or fractional CFO?
A2:
 If your revenue is under $50M and you don't need 40+ hours/week of strategic finance work, fractional is more cost-effective. You get senior-level expertise at a fraction of the cost.
Q3: Can you work with our existing accounting team?
A3:
 Yes. We collaborate with your bookkeeper, controller, or accounting firm. We focus on strategy and analysis while they handle day-to-day transaction processing.
Q4: Do you help with fundraising?
A4:
 Yes. We build financial models, create investor-ready materials, prepare data rooms, and help you answer investor diligence questions confidently.
Q5: What tools do you use?
A5:
 We're platform-agnostic and work with QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Google Sheets, Excel, and most modern finance tools. We adapt to your existing stack.

Card 3: Investor Expectations
 Investors and acquirers expect compliant 409A valuations. It's standard practice for venture-backed companies.
Card 4: Future Fundraising
 A recent 409A is often required during due diligence for fundraising or M&A transactions.

SECTION 7 — FAQ
Q1: When do I need a 409A valuation?
A1:
 You need a 409A before issuing your first stock options and then: (1) at least every 12 months, (2) within 30 days of a material event (fundraise, M&A offer, major milestone), or (3) when your prior 409A expires.
Q2: How long is a 409A valid?
A2:
 409A valuations are valid for 12 months OR until a material event occurs (whichever comes first). Material events include fundraising, significant revenue changes, or M&A offers.
Q3: What information do you need from us?
A3:
 We need: current cap table, recent financial statements (past 2 years + projections), recent fundraising documents (if any), and company overview (business model, products, market).
Q4: Can we expedite the process?
A4:
 Yes. For an additional fee, we can deliver in 3-5 business days. Contact us to discuss expedited timing.
Q5: What valuation methods do you use?
A5:
 We use the Option Pricing Method (OPM) or Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (PWERM) depending on your stage. We may also consider market multiples and discounted cash flow analysis.
Q6: Will this affect my next fundraising valuation?
A6:
 No. 409A values common stock for option pricing. Preferred stock (what investors buy) is valued differently and typically higher due to liquidation preferences and other rights.

 Delaware requires an annual report ($300/year for corps, $300/year for LLCs) plus registered agent fees. You'll also need to file federal tax returns annually. We can handle ongoing compliance if needed.
