# Gap Analysis: Implementation vs Content.txt

## Global / General
- **External Subdomains vs Internal Routes**: The "Home - Service Lines Grid" section in `content.txt` lists subdomains (e.g., `resolution.eazytaxes.com`) for service links, but the code implements internal routes (e.g., `/tax-resolution`). However, detailed page specs later in `content.txt` (e.g., "PAGE 1: TAX RESOLUTION SERVICES") use the internal URLs. *Recommendation: The internal routes (`/tax-resolution`, etc.) appear correct based on the presence of detailed page specs.*

## Home Page (https://eazytaxes.com)
- **Hero Secondary CTA**: Implementation includes "Explore services" button. Spec says "No secondary CTA needed on hero for now".
- **Intro Section**:
  - Spec: "Eazytaxes Inc. is a US-based professional services firm offering tax, compliance, assurance, and advisory services to businesses and individuals."
  - Implementation: "We provide comprehensive tax and accounting solutions..." (Text differs).
  - Implementation Deviation: Includes a 4-column stats grid not in the Home spec (though good for credibility, it's not in the requirements).
- **Section 6 - Credentials/Positioning Strip**:
  - Spec: "US-based professional services firm · Cross-border and domestic matters · Project-based and ongoing engagements"
  - Implementation: Uses a stats strip ("IRS-certified professionals · 5,000+ returns filed...") instead.
- **Section 7 - Who We Work With**:
  - Spec: Bullet list ("Founders and owner-led businesses", etc.)
  - Implementation: Missing. (Replaced by "Why Us" / Testimonials?)
- **Section 8 - Engagements**:
  - Spec: List of engagement types ("One-time engagements", etc.)
  - Implementation: Missing.
- **Section 9 - Jurisdiction / Scope Line**:
  - Spec: "US regulatory and advisory work for domestic and international clients."
  - Implementation: Missing.
- **Final CTA**:
  - Spec: Text "Ready to proceed?", Button "Start Here".
  - Implementation: Text "Ready for Complete Financial Clarity?", Button "Book a Consultation" and "Get Started".
- **Section 4 - Global CTA**: "Not sure which service applies? ... /start". **Missing** (Spec says place under services grid).
- **Footer Confidence Line**: "All services are provided by...". ✅ **Present** in `Footer.tsx` and visible on Home.


## Tax & Compliance Page (/tax-compliance)
- **Status**: ✅ **High Conformity**. Matches spec for Pricing, Deliverables, Situations, and FAQ.
- **Minor Gaps**:
  - **Hero Tertiary CTA**: Spec asks for text link "Not sure which service applies? -> /start". **Missing** in Hero (though present in FAQ).

## Tax Resolution Page (/tax-resolution)
- **Hero Section**:
  - H1: Spec "Resolve Your IRS Tax Problems" vs Imp "Tax Resolution & Defense".
  - **Tertiary CTA**: "Not sure? -> /start" is **Missing**.

- **Section 3 - Trust Bar**: Stats ($2.5M+ resolved) is **Missing**.
- **Pricing / Service Types**:
  - Spec: "Offer in Compromise", "Installment Agreement", "Penalty Abatement".
  - Implementation: "IRS Audit Defense", "Penalty Abatement", "Full Representation". (Partial mismatch in service structuring).

- **Section 6 - Process**: Spec has 4 steps. Implementation has 3 steps.
- **FAQ**: Spec has 6 items. Implementation has 3 items.


## Assurance & SOC 2 Page (/assurance-soc2)
- **Concept Mismatch**: **Implementation ignores "Assurance"** (Compilations, Reviews, Audits) and replaces it with "SOC 2" as the primary product. The Spec defined SOC 2 as just a secondary mention.
- **Pricing / Services**:
  - Spec: "Compilation", "Review", "Audit" (Tiers of Assurance).

## CFO & Advisory Page (/cfo-advisory)
- **Pricing / Services**:
  - Spec: "Advisory" (10hr), "Strategic CFO" (20hr), "Full-Service CFO". (Focus on *Time/Engagement Level*).

  - **Trust Bar**: Missing.
  - **Process Section**: Missing.
  - **"Who We Work With"**: Missing.
- **FAQ**: Spec has 5, Implementation has 3.


## Valuations Page (/valuations)
- **Concept Mismatch**: Spec focuses exclusively on "409A Valuations" tiered by company stage. Implementation broadens scope to include "Business Valuation" (M&A) and "Fairness Opinions".
- **Hero**:
  - H1: "409A Valuations for Startups" vs "Valuations & 409A".
  - **Tertiary CTA** ("Not sure? -> /start") is **Missing**.
- **Trust Bar**: Spec stats missing.
- **Pricing / Services**:
  - Spec: "Seed Stage", "Series A / Growth", "Late Stage". (Tiers of 409A).
  - Implementation: "409A Valuation", "Business Valuation", "Fairness Opinion". (Different Service Types).
- **Missing Sections**:
  - "Why Startups Need 409A" Section **Missing**.
  - Process Section **Missing**.
- **FAQ**: Spec has 6, Implementation has 3.

## US Formation Page (/us-formation)
- **Hero**:
  - H1: "Start Your US Business the Right Way" vs "US Formation & Banking".
  - **Tertiary CTA** ("Not sure? -> /start") is **Missing**.
- **Trust Bar**: Spec stats missing.
- **Pricing / Services**:
  - Spec: "LLC", "C-Corp", "Full Setup (Formation + Banking)".
  - Implementation: "Delaware LLC", "C-Corp Formation", "Banking Setup" (Banking is a separate card, not a bundle).
- **Missing Sections**:
  - "Benefits of US Entity Formation" Section **Missing** (Replaced by "Included in Formation" deliverables).
  - "Entity Comparison Table" (LLC vs C-Corp) is **Missing**.
  - Process Section **Missing**.
  - "Who We Help" (Countries list) is **Missing** (Replaced by Situations grid).
- **FAQ**: Spec has 6, Implementation has 3.

## Summary
- **High Conformity**: `TaxCompliance` (only missing Hero tertiary link).
- **Medium Divergence**: `TaxResolution` (Correct core service, but missing specific content blocks like Alert Bar and Trust stats).
- **High Divergence**: `Assurance`, `CFO`, `Valuations`, `Formation`. These pages fundamentally restructure the service offering (e.g., changing from "Tiers of one service" to "Menu of different services") and consistently omit trust signals (stats), process diagrams, and comparison tables requested in `content.txt`.
